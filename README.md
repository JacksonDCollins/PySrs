# PySrs

Currently not in a state for new users. Need to work on inital set up and packaging of required external libraries. If downloaded as is from the repository, you'll be using the program while missing some vital files, you will need to create these yourself. May also require external libraries to be downloaded if you don't already have them.

Am currently developing.
